Overview
--------

This page contains information to get {+service+} integrated into your
Electron application quickly. To learn how to set up an Electron
application with Realm without using any additional frameworks, see the
:ref:`Electron set up <electron-setup>` instructions. If you have
already created an application using `Create React App
<https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html>`_ or are
interested in integrating a React App with Realm using Electron, check
out the :ref:`Electron with React set up <react-electron-setup>`
instructions.

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- :ref:`Created a {+app+} <create-a-realm-app>`
- :ref:`Enabled {+sync+} <enable-sync>`

.. admonition:: Version Requirement
   :class: note

   {+service+} works with any of the officially supported Electron
   versions. We recommend using the latest stable release. To see the
   officially supported Electron versions, check out the `Electron
   Releases <https://www.electronjs.org/releases/>`_ document.

Set up

Working with Realm Using Renderer and Main Processes
----------------------------------------------------

Electron applications have one main process. The main process can create
multiple BrowserWindows. Each BrowserWindow spawns its own process.
This presents the following unique challenges when developing
applications using Electron and Realm:

- Two different processes cannot access a synced realm. Due to this, the recommended course of action is to only open non-synced realms on renderer processes and only one synced realm on the main process.
- Since you're opening a non-synced a realm on the renderer process, you must notify the main process when the renderer performs a write transaction. The main process can then upload the local non-synced changes to the sync session.

Consider the following code in the ``main process``:

.. note::

   If you have set up your application using Create React App, make sure
   to pass in the ``index.html`` file in your ``build`` folder to the
   `window.loadFile()
   <https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window#winloadfilefilepath-options>`_
   method. You can do so by replacing line 11 with
   ``mainWindow.loadFile("./build/index.html");``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/QuickStarts/electron/quickstart-main.js
  :language: javascript
  :emphasize-lines: 38, 41, 45, 47, 58
  :linenos:

Notice that on line 39, the main process opens a synced realm. On line
45, the `ipcMain <https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-main>`_
Electron API listens for an "asynchronous-message" event. When an
asynchronous message occurs with the “sync” argument, the main process
uploads all local changes. On line 58, a reply is sent to the renderer
process that tells it the name of the person object created.

Consider the ``renderer process`` code:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/QuickStarts/electron/quickstart-renderer.js
  :language: javascript
  :emphasize-lines: 27, 37, 40
  :linenos:

On line 28, the renderer process opens a non-synced realm. All write
transactions on this local realm will not be synced by default. In order
to sync these writes, the `ipcRenderer
<https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-renderer>`_ Electron API emits
an "asynchronous-message" with the argument "sync" on line 42. This
tells the ``main process`` to upload all local changes to the synced
realm. On line 40, the ``ipcRenderer`` listens or a reply from the
``main process`` and console logs that reply.

Output
~~~~~~
Run ``npm start`` to start your application. You should see the
following output in your terminal:

.. code-block:: shell

   main process: Syncing all local changes
   main process: Created person object: 	 {
     "_id": "5f8535d8693c6be10db53cfb",
     "name": "John Smith"
   }

If you open the ``devtools`` in your electron application, you should
see the following console output:

.. code-block:: shell

   renderer process: created person object with the name John Smith

Summary
-------

- You can create an Electron Application using {+service+} by installing `Electron <https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron>`_ and the `MongoDB Realm JS SDK <https://www.npmjs.com/package/realm>`_.
- You can create a React application that uses Realm and Electron with `craco <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@craco/craco>`_.
- Since 2 different processes cannot access a synced realm, open a non-synced realm on the renderer processes and a synced realm on the main process.
- Notify the main process that a write transaction has occurred on the renderer process with the `ipcMain <https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-main>`_ and the `ipcRenderer <https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-renderer>`_ APIs.
